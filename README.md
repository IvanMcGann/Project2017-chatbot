#Introduction:
My name is Ivan mcGann, I'm a Year 3 student studying Computing in Software Development in GMIT. This is a project in Data Representation and Querying.
The project implements html, golang, json, Ajax and Bootstrap to create a chatbot that can take in input from the user and reply.  
Really found some aspects difficult as my experience with golang and ajax. I really struggled getting the javascript working on the html file, I chose to not make it a seperate file, and completely ignored css after tryig to style the background a bit more.
Only studied go for a few months so doing a project presented its challenges despite the problem sheet. 

# Instructions:
How to download the chatbot:
1. Visit and sign in to github @ www.github.com
2. Find my github repository at the following (public) repository link: https://github.com/IvanMcGann/Project2017-chatbot
3. Once found search the right hand side of the page for a button saying clone or download, press it and i gives you an option to download the zip or to copy the link.
4. If you chose to download the zip skip ahead to step 6, otherwise open your command line or cmder.
5. Here make your way to the directory you want to store the project.
	(a) To copy the reposity enter into the command line "git clone https://github.com/IvanMcGann/Project2017-chatbot"
	(b) Once change into the projects folder (cd Project2017-chatbot) then type dir into the command line to check if you have all the contents.
6. Once you have done this you then build the .go file into an .exe file. The .go file in my project is called (chatbot.go),
	build a .exe file by entering go build or go build chatbot.go
7. Once built run the .exe file called Project2017-chatbot.exe (if you enter go build) or (if you enter go build chatbot.go) chatbot.exe
8. When it runs its served on an address called localhostr:8080
9. On an online browser go to 127.0.0.1:8080
10. Here you can enter in text and onscreen you get responses to your input.
